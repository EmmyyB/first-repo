<h2>The transition-timing-function Property</h2>

<p>Hover over the div elements below, to see the different speed curves:</p>

<div class="time" id="div3">linear</div><br>
<div class="time" id="div4">ease</div><br>
<div class="time" id="div5">ease-in</div><br>
<div class="time" id="div6">ease-out</div><br>
<div class="time" id="div7">ease-in-out</div><br>


<h2>The transition-delay Property</h2>

<p>Hover over the div element below, to see the transition effect:</p>

<div class="div8"></div>

<p><b>Note:</b> The transition effect has a 1 second delay before starting.</p>

<h1>Animations</h1>
<h2>What are CSS Animations?
</h2>
<p>
    An animation lets an element gradually change from one style to another.

    You can change as many CSS properties you want, as many times as you want.
    
    To use CSS animation, you must first specify some keyframes for the animation.
    
    Keyframes hold what styles the element will have at certain times.
    </p>

<br><br><br>

<h2>The @keyframes Rule</h2>
<p>
    When you specify CSS styles inside the @keyframes rule, the animation will gradually change from the current style to the new style at certain times.

To get an animation to work, you must bind the animation to an element.

The following example binds the "example" animation to the <div> element. The animation will last for 4 seconds, and it will gradually change the background-color of the <div> element from "red" to "yellow":

<h3>CSS Animation</h3>

<div class="diw"></div>

<p><b>Note:</b> When an animation is finished, it goes back to its original style.</p>


<h1>CSS Animation</h1>

<div class="dix"></div>

<p><b>Note:</b> When an animation is finished, it goes back to its original style.</p>


<h1>CSS Animation</h1>

<div class="dip"></div>

<p><b>Note:</b> When an animation is finished, it goes back to its original style.</p>


<h1>CSS Animation</h1>

<p>The animation-delay property specifies a delay for the start of an animation. The following example has a 2 seconds delay before starting the animation:</p>

<p>
    Using negative values in the animation-delay property: Here, the animation will start as if it had already been playing for 2 seconds:

</p>
<div class="dim"></div>

<h1>CSS Animation</h1>

<p>The animation-iteration-count property specifies the number of times an animation should run. The following example will run the animation 3 times before it stops:</p>

<div class="dii"></div>


<h1>CSS Animation</h1>

<p>The animation-iteration-count property can be set to infinite to let the animation run for ever:</p>

<div class="dig"></div>

<h1>Run Animation in Reverse Direction or Alternate Cycles
</h1>
<p>
    The animation-direction property specifies whether an animation should be played forwards, backwards or in alternate cycles.

    The animation-direction property can have the following values:
    
    normal - The animation is played as normal (forwards). This is default
    reverse - The animation is played in reverse direction (backwards)
    alternate - The animation is played forwards first, then backwards
    alternate-reverse - The animation is played backwards first, then forwards
</p>

<p>The animation-direction property specifies whether an animation should be played forwards, backwards or in alternate cycles. The following example will run the animation in reverse direction (backwards):</p>
