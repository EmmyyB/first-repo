			JAVASCRIPT

javascript is a dynamic programming language use for both client side and server side.
for client side we use script
for server side we use server

		uses of javascript

1, web development
2, game building
3, exam questions

		steps in writing a good program

1, know how to declare variable.  a variable is a container that holds value.
2, assign value(s). an array have to do with multiple value.
3, perform calculations
4, display result/ output
5, handle errors   types of error handling(default error, customer error handling)

		how to display result
document.write()	this is now old, we dont use it now
console.log()          this is mainly used for testing your program
inner HTML
innerText
textcontent
			
			types of variable
1, global variable are variables that can be used within and outside the building block
2, local variables are those variable that can be used only within the building block.

		declaring a variable

const  - this is a global variable and a constant variable cant be altered
var	-- this is also a global variable
let	- this is a local variable

		datatypes

it defines the type of data a variable holds
1, integers (whole number)
2, string text. it works with 'or"
3, boolean  it has to do with True or False  0=false 1=true   note booleans must be in small letter
4, null empty
5, float for decimal

we use (typeof()) to know the datatype of a data
eg typeof("3")

-- note javascript is case sensitve

		NAMING CONVENTION	
it is the standard way of providing a name for your variables
1, you must not start with numbers
2, you can only start with underscore(_) and $ sign special character no other special character..
3, you cant use built in methods or reserved words for a variable name

		ARITHEMETIC OPERATIONS
addition
division
subtraction
multiplication
modulus		THIS RETURNS A REMEMDER AS A RESULT.. if the first number is smaller that the second number then the modulus is the first number 2%5 =2
exponetial ** 

		if statement 
it returns true if a result is correct and false if the condition is wrong.
it works with two or more values

if = 
else = 

		Comparison
>
<
>=
<=
!= OR <>
= normal equal
== equality
=== stictly equal to, its used to test
